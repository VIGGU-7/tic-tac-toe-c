# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C

A simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in the C programming language. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like arrays, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

---

## Features
- Two-player gameplay.
- Simple, easy-to-use console interface.
- Detects win, loss, and draw conditions.
- Clean and modular code.

---

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking their symbol (`X` or `O`) in an empty cell.
3. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- Basic understanding of C programming.

### Steps to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository or download the `tictac.c` file.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler:
